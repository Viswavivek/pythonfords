1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.
2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and last 2 characters of a given string. If the string length is less than 2, return the empty string instead.
      Sample String : 'sairam'
      Expected Result : 'saam'
      Sample String : 'a3'
      Expected Result : 'a3a3'
      Sample String : 'a'
      Expected Result : Empty String
4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'
5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
