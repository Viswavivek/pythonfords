1. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number, and multiples of five, print Buzz. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz.
2. Create a class with a constructor that initializes instance variables. Define a class method to create an instance with default values.
3. Implement a static method that performs a utility function related to the class but doesn't depend on instance-specific data.
4. Create a class with a class variable to keep track of the number of instances created. Update the class variable in the constructor.
5. Implement a class with a static method that performs a basic calculation (e.g., addition, subtraction) without relying on instance-specific data.
6. Design a class with a class method that acts as a factory, creating and returning instances based on certain criteria.
7. Create a class with a static method that performs string manipulation (e.g., reversing, converting to uppercase) without relying on instance-specific data.
8. Implement a class with a class method that validates input parameters before creating an instance.
